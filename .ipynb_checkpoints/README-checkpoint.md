This project uses time series and regression analysis to predict Yen's future price movement

## A Yen for the Future

In this project we are trying to predict Yen's future price in order to make a decision whether it makes sense to buy it now. In attempts to forecast the price movement, we are building the ARMA, ARIMA, and GARCH models.

In addition to that, we are building a SKLearn linear regression models to predict Yen futures returns.
